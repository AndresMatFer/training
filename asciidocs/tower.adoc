= Get started with Nextflow Tower

== Basic concepts

Nextflow Tower is the centralized command-post for the management of Nextflow data pipelines. 
It brings monitoring, logging & observability, to distributed workflows and simplifies the deployment of pipelines on any cloud, cluster or laptop. 


Nextflow tower core features include:

* the launching of pre-configured pipelines with ease
* programmatic integration to meet the needs of organizations
* publishing pipelines to shared workspaces 
* management of infrastructure required to run data analysis at scale


TIP: https://tower.nf/[Sign] up to try Tower for free or request a https://meetings.hubspot.com/evan141[demo] for deployments in your own on-premise or cloud environment.

== Usage

You can use Tower via either the **online GUI**, using the `-with-tower` option with the **Nextflow run command**, or through the **API**.

=== Via online GUI

**1.** Create an account and login into Tower, available free of charge, at https://tower.nf[tower.nf].

**2.** Create and configure a new https://help.tower.nf/compute-envs/overview/[compute environment].

**3.** Start https://help.tower.nf/launch/launchpad/[launching pipelines].

=== Via Nextflow run command

Create an account and login into Tower.

**1. Create a new token**

  You can access your tokens from the The *Settings* drop-down menu :

**2. Name your token**

**3. Save your token safely**

NOTE: Copy and keep your new token in a safe place.

**4. Export your token**

Once your token has been created, open a terminal and type:

[source,bash,linenums]
----
export TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN=eyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxQ1ZTE=
export NXF_VER=20.10.0
----

Where `eyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxQ1ZTE=` is the token you have just created.

NOTE: "check your Nextflow version". Bearer tokens require Nextflow version 20.10.0 or later, set with the second command above.

To submit a pipeline to a https://help.tower.nf/getting-started/workspace/[Workspace] using the Nextflow command line tool, add the workspace ID to your environment. For example

[source,bash,linenums]
----
export TOWER_WORKSPACE_ID=000000000000000
----

The workspace ID can be found on the organisation's Workspaces overview page.

**5. Run Nextflow with tower**

Run your Nextflow workflows as usual with the addition of the `-with-tower` command:

[source,bash,linenums]
----
nextflow run hello.nf -with-tower
----

You will see and be able to monitor your **Nextflow jobs** in Tower.

To configure and execute Nextflow jobs in **Cloud environments**, visit the https://help.tower.nf/compute-envs/overview/[Compute environments section].
