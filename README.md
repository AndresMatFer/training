**The sidebar** allows you to customise your Gitpod environment and perform basic tasks (Copy/Paste, Open files, search, git, etc.) Click the Explorer button to see which files are in this repository.

**The terminal** allows you to run all the programs in the repository, for example `nextflow` and `docker` are installed. 

**The main window** allows you to view and edit files. Clicking on a file in the explorer will open it within the main window. Once a file is open, Markdown or HTML can be rendered using the preview option. We can also see the nf-trainin material in this window, or you can open in separately in another browser winder (https://training.seqera.io/)

Gitpod gives you 50 hours per month to run the environment, with up to 4 parellel workspaces at a time.
